>A simple smart contract to realize the voting function using Solidty.

I just use the **Remix IDE** to deploy my smart contract and use **Ganache** to test it

I use python **web3** library to achieve the interaction between python and the smart contract 
and use **Flask** to realize a simple user interface, so authorized voters can vote via the browser.
